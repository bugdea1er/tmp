/// process of creating and managing temporary files by ensuring that they are
/// properly cleaned up when they are no longer needed.
///
/// When a tmp::file object is created, it creates a temporary file using the
/// system's default location for temporary files. If a prefix is provided to
/// the constructor, the file is created in the path
/// <system's default location for temporary files>/prefix/. The prefix can be
/// a path consisting of multiple segments.
///
/// The tmp::file class also provides an additional write and append methods
/// which allow writing data to the temporary file.
///
/// When the object is destroyed, it deletes the temporary file.
///
/// @note The tmp::file class cannot be copied or moved, as it is designed to
/// manage a single temporary file. If you need to create multiple temporary
/// files, you should create multiple instances of the class.
