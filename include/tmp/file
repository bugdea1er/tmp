/// tmp::file is a smart handle that owns and manages a temporary file and
/// deletes it when this handle goes out of scope
///
/// When a tmp::file object is created, it creates a unique temporary file using
/// the system's default location for temporary files; the path consists of the
/// system's temporary directory path, the given prefix, and random characters
/// to ensure path uniqueness
///
/// The managed file is deleted of when either of the following happens:
/// - the managing tmp::file object is destroyed
/// - the managing tmp::file object is assigned another path via operator=
///
/// tmp::file provides additional `write` and `append` methods
/// which allow writing data to the temporary file
///
/// The following example uses a tmp::file object to create a temporary file
/// and write a string to it; when the function returns, the tmp::file object
/// goes out of scope and the temporary file:
///
/// @code{.cpp}
///   #include <tmp/file>
///
///   auto func(std::string_view content) {
///     auto tmpfile = tmp::file("org.example.product");
///     tmpfile.write(content);

///     // the temporary file is deleted recursively when the
///     // tmp::file object goes out of scope and is destroyed
///   }
